//From main we are starting program so we need to bring the UI to scene 1 (login),
// and then from there try to give control to the individual controllers based on userType

//Data Abstraction (Locally based implementation--remove when implementing database)
//Map of valid usernames and passwords [DONE]
//Login scene: [DONE]
//Right now in the main file
//Could be extracted into its own class later

//within the scene the interactions should confirm validity of login [DONE]
//then assign the user with a session
//and in creating a session assign the correct type of controller
//in order to bring it to the next screen
//imo what makes sense is have a session obj that we have 3 different constructors for
//*KIERA: can create a session interface, implimented by 3 diff classes for the diff users
//if we have a session constructed with a admin type, in its creation its should bring
//the user to the next scene? in its construction create a new gui? that overrides the login gui'

//TO DO:
//Create Login GUI, that leads to two different screens login & register [DONE]
//Create fields in the login scene that check with the local map to see if the login info is valid [DONE]
//Create fields in the register scene, that accept valid formatted info and add that data to the map [DONE]
//Extract login and register button scenes to separate classes & link to one gui
